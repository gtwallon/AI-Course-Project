The **Mancala_Project_Wallon_Gabe** jupyter notebook in this repository was the final deliverable for an Intro-to-AI course project.
Some of the code used to complete the assignment was not authored by me - this code is specified 
in the jupyter notebook. I also used the **games4e** jupyter notebook provided by the textbook AI: A Modern Approach (Norvig) as a guide to complete the assignment.
